# PID controller optimization using generic algorithms

This is the code to optimize the PID parameters of a controller using genetic algorithms. It was developed during my [PhD thesis](http://miguelgfierro.com/docs/gonzalez-fierro2014thesis.pdf). 

The optimization method is a genetic algorithm called [Differential Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution). This algorithm is a good method for multiobjective optimization with constraints.
